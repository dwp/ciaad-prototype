    First iteration. Designed using a modified version of the GOVUK Autocomplete 
    component so that we can show the address.

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Research notes</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    Didn't test particularly well. The lookup only includes English hospitals so 
    Scottish or Welsh ones can be confusing. Also, the address isn't passed into 
    the input when a selection is made, so agents were manually adding it at the 
    end even though they don't need to as the address could be passed in the 
    background.
